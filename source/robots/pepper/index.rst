On these pages, you can find quick start information about Pepper in the robot house.
Our documentation covers how to start and stop the robot, charge its batteries, and how to use some of its software and remote control.
Moreover, there is an introduction to preconfigured interactive demonstration and apps as well as a section on how to securely transport the robot.
A comprehensive user manual and software overview can be found in the `Developer portal`_.
