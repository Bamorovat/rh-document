 Applications
=============

We have provided :ref:`pepper` with a couple of general demonstrations that can be used for showcasing its interactive capabilities.
These demonstrations are independent of robot house and do not rely on any of our infrastructure. They are therefore well suited for :ref:`pepper_ontour`.
To start the demonstrations, you have to run them from `Choregraphe`_. Please connect your instance to the robot as described in :ref:`pepper_startup`.
If you use a robot house computer, run the following.

.. note::

  You can also install and start Choregraphe on any other computer or laptop, for example if you have :ref:`pepper_ontour`.

------------------------
Overview of applications
------------------------

All demonstrations are preinstalled on the robot and can be started from the  Choregraphe main window.
Find the `robot applications` view (cf. :numref:`fig_pepper_apps`) in the lower left part of the window and expand the application that you want to execute.
Click the green play symbol next to `behavior.xar` to run the application.

The robot also has an `Autonomous life`_ mode that is quite useful for demonstration and can be used to trigger some of the apps.

Grease Dance

This application comes with a short introductionary dialogue that asks the user to participate.
Besides triggering the behaviour, the robot is also able to respond to simple greetings.

Please use one of these as a trigger:
 * Dance
 * Let's dance
 * Do you want to dance?

.. note::

  Please have in mind that the robot is trained to recognise US American accents.

Please use the following as a confirmation:
 * Yes/Yeah/Yep
 * Sure

Please use the following as a negation:
 * No/Nope
 * Never heard
