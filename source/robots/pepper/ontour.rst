Transport
---------

.. note::

  :ref:`pepper` has its own transport box that should always be used when the robot needs to go to a different building.
  The robot should be transported using a platfrom trolley for short distances and a spacious car or van for longer distances.
  Please refer to campusservices or helpdesk for assistance.

Please follow these instructions when getting :ref:`pepper` ready for transport.

.. warning::

  The robot, especially its arms and fingers, are fragile! Please take extra care when handling the robot with its breaks released.

Setup
-----

#. Set up the table so that you have space to sit and store your belongings, wires, boxes etc. Cover the table in tablecloths and fix them using sticky tape if necessary.

#. Place and plug in a monitor (or large screen) on the table so that it faces the visitors and connect it to your PC/laptop for demonstrating the robot's perception.

#. Put the charger underneath the table so that you can charge the robot while it is standing in front of the table.

#. Place and plug in the router underneath the table (or otherwise invisibly). Connect your PC/laptop with one of the router's four yellow sockets using a network cable.

#. Fix wires to the floor using sticky tape to eliminate tripping hazards.

#. Set up the robot house banner in a prominent place besides the table so that visitors can still see the monitor, robot, and you.

#. Make sure everything is tidy and looks appealing to visitors.

.. note::

  :ref:`pepper` should automatically pick up the WiFi the router provides. You can make it say the robot's current IP address by pressing its chest button once.
