Collaboration
-------------

We use `<https://gitlab.com/>`_ as a collaboration and development platform.
We have established the group **UH Robot House** (`robothouse <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/>`_) which contains the following sub-groups:

 * **User projects** (`rh-user <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-user>`_): Projects containing publicly available resources that belong to Robot House and where collaborators can typically contribute. Projects can also contain individual research projects that are realised in Robot House. Important projects that every contributor should be aware of:
 
    * The technical `user documentation <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-user/rh-userdocs>`__ (the pages you read right now).
    * Robot House `ROS packages <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-user/uh_robot_cfg>`_.
    * Robot House `Environment configuration <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-user/rh-env>`_.
    
  .. note:: User projects usually rely on issues, merge requests, and other DevOps features for contribution and collaboration. Please contact the `team`_ if you need assistance with those.

 * **Papers** (`rh-papers <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-papers>`_): Projects for internal and external papers that are part of Robot House research (`example paper project <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-papers/credibility-safety-experiment>`_). Typically, there is one project for every paper or collection of related papers that is accessible to all co-authors of this paper. Such a project usually consists of:
 
    * Repository: LaTeX sources for the paper
    * Issues: Writing To-dos, deadline management, ...
    * Wiki: Drafts, ideas, discussions, ...

 * **Experiments** (`rh-experiments <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-experiments>`_): Projects for internal and external researchersâ€™ experiments that take place in Robot House (`example experiment project <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-experiments/SocCred>`_). Typically, there is one project for every experiment that contains the following:
 
    * Repository: Code for controlling experiments, statistical evaluation, ...
    * Issues: Programming duties, Experiment organisation, ...
    * Wiki: Experiment description and planning, document (drafts) such as ethics applications, ...
 
 * **Collaboration projects** (`rh-collab <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-collab>`_): Projects for individual collaboration with Robot House partners.

 * **Admin projects** (`rh-adm <https://gitlab.com/robothouse/rh-adm>`_): Internal projects, issue tracking, and wikis for Robot House.
