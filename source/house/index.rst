==================
 Using Robot House
==================

Please pay attention to the following rules whenever you are using the house.

Access and booking
==================

.. note:: Access to Robot House is managed by the core `team`_ (Patrick and Farshid) who will provide you with the alarm codes and keys on request.

Robot House is shared by many researchers, so please indicate your usage in the shared calendar that you will also have access to.
Use the tags ``[exclusive]`` or ``[not exclusive]`` to indicate whether you need exclusive and uninterrupted access, for example when conducting a user study.
Please also pay attention to the times that have already been entered by others and do not modify any of them without consulting the `team`_.
The calendar is working on a basis of trust so that everyone can indicate their usage in a flexible way.

Safety and security
===================

.. note:: Please pay attention to the risk assessment displayed in the entrance area.


#. The emergency number to be used for urgent cases is ``+44 (0)1707 28 5555``. In non-urgent cases, you can reach `security`_ at ``+44 (0)1707 28 1010``.
#. The safety and security of the equipment in the house is very important. Please use the alarm system, ensure all windows and doors are locked when you leave, always lock the front door with the chubb (big) key and ensure curtains are closed when robots and equipment are on view.
#. Always let one of the key `team`_ members know if there has been any problem with the alarm (e.g., not being on when you arrive at the house when no one is there, or going off) or with the door not being locked with the chubb key when you arrive.
#. Always let security know if you are still in the house after 19.00 and always ring them again to tell them you are leaving.

Miscellaneous
=============

.. note:: Everyone who uses the house is responsible for the house - so please let the `team`_ know if you notice anything that is needed or is faulty or broken so that we can address the issue or contact `Estates`_.

#. No personal visitors or colleagues can be invited to Robot House unless they are there for research related purpose or for events that the key `team`_ knows about.
#. There is no TV license so it is illegal to watch TV on the wall screen or on any computers or laptops in the house. However, catch up on computers is legal. If the TV licensing people ring the doorbell it is important that you tell them that the house does not use TV at all. Please let Patrick (or Farshid) know if they call.
#. The landline phone locked in the office is strictly only for AS work related or emergency calls as the bills come out of the project budget.
#. There is no budget for furniture an non-research related equipment, so if you break or burn anything you must replace it. Liaise with the `team`_ in case we can help.
#. Please take all your rubbish with you, the bins in Robot House are not in use.
